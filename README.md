CameraModels
=============

This is a small header only library of templated C++11 classes implementing 
various camera models.

Based on Eigen and Sophus for algebra and 3D transformations.

## Features
Each class provides both normal and static methods for the following functions:

* `forward (3d_point) -> pixel`,
* `forward (pose, 3d_point) -> pixel`,
* `inverse (pixel) -> 3d_point`, either unit vector or on image plane Z=1,
* `inverseAtDistance (pixel, distance) -> 3d_point`,
* `inverseAtDistance (pose, pixel, distance) -> 3d_point`,
* `twoFrameProject (pose1, pixel1, pose2) -> 3d_point`,
* `worldToCamera(pose, 3d_point) -> 3d_point`,
* `cameraToWorld(pose, 3d_point) -> 3d_point`,
* `pixelValid(pixel) -> bool`,
* `cast<NewScalarType>()`,
* `resizeViewport(dimensions)`.

##### Type safety
Each model is templated with the scalar type (e.g. float, double). Statically
typed models can work across CUDA host-device boundary provided the underlying 
infrastructure is CUDA ready (Eigen + Sophus). Additionally, each model can be 
wrapped into _Eigen::Map_ (useful when used inside Ceres-Solver cost functions).

While each model is typed with the default scalar type, most of the methods can be
retyped with a different type. For example, when doing camera calibration with 
Ceres-Solver automatic differentiation typing the entire model with _ceres::Jet_
is necessary, while when solving Bundle-Adjustment problem the camera model class
can stay typed with double, while only the _forward<ceres::Jet>(...)_ call 
being typed with _ceres::Jet_ to carry out the derivation.

##### Conventions
Poses are _Sophus::SE3Group_ Lie algebra transformations, points and pixels are Eigen
3D and 2D vectors (see [CameraModelHelpers.hpp](CameraModelHelpers.hpp) for conventions).

##### Calibration
Some models do not support calibration, as it wasn't tested. Each model provides
the following constants:
* NumParameters - total number of parameters, including miscellanea like width & height,
* ParametersToOptimize - first N parameters, only the ones to optimize, 
* CalibrationSupported - true/false, if the model supports calibration.

Most models were tested with Ceres-Solver based calibration employing automatic differentiation.

#####  Dynamic Polymorphism
If run time polymorphism is needed for whatever reason one might use _CameraInterface_ class
and wrap statically typed model with _CameraFromCRTP_ that exposes virtual functions.

##### Misc. features
Each camera model has _std::ostream_ operator. Optionally, Boost Serialization or
Cereal serialization is supported (see [CameraModelHelpers.hpp](CameraModelHelpers.hpp) for more info)
Camera models with distortions implement _getIdeal()_ method that returns the
corresponding camera model class with distortions omitted. Note: this is a very crude
way of obtaining the ideal camera model to work on undistorted images.

## Models supported

* Pinhole - classical pinhole camera model, however inverts with distance,
* PinholeDistorted - as above, but with radial-tangential distortions,
* IdealGeneric - Gayer/Baretto/Mei generic central camera model,
* FullGeneric - as above, but with radial-tangential distortions,
* Spherical - simple spherical panorama,
* SphericalPovRay - as above, but following PovRay conventions,
* IdealFisheye - fisheye camera model as seen in OpenCV 3.0,
* Fisheye - as above, including extra distortion coefficients,
* PinholeDisparity - classical pinhole camera model, inverse on the image planes,
* PinholeDisparityDistorted - as above, but with radial-tangential distortions,
* PinholeDisparityBrownConrady - special case, non invertible. See Intel's librealsense.

## TODO
* Much more testing, not just simple forward/inverse checks,
* Additional projection-unprojection checking functions, tests for chirality etc.,
* Implement camera rig type to represent multi-camera systems.
